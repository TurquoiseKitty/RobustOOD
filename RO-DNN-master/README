Data and code for the paper "Data-Driven Robust Optimization using Unsupervised Deep Learning" by Marc Goerigk and Jannis Kurtz

Structure:
- 2d, 20d, path: Folders for each of three experiments
- in each of these folders, there are four sub-folders:
-- data: test and training data
-- kernel: trained kernel parameters
-- nn: trained nn parameters
-- solutions: output of optimization

- code: there are four sub-folders:
-- generator: a python file used to generate random data
-- solver: optimization code, takes trained parameters as input
-- train_kernel: code to train kernel
-- train_nn: code to train nn in combination with the Deep SVDD code from
https://github.com/lukasruff/Deep-SVDD-PyTorch

- scripts: shell scripts used to run experiments, which in particular give parameter choices
